## Data Models and APIs

### Data Models

The system uses well-defined TypeScript constants in `lib/supabase.js`:

```javascript
// Device categorization
DEVICE_TYPES: {
  DISCONNECT_SWITCH: 'disconnect_switch',
  FUSE_COMBINATION: 'fuse_combination', 
  SWITCH_DISCONNECTOR: 'switch_disconnector'
}

// Session lifecycle management
TEST_SESSION_STATUS: {
  IN_PROGRESS: 'in_progress',
  COMPLETED: 'completed',
  FAILED: 'failed'
}

// Role-based access control hierarchy
USER_ROLES: {
  ADMIN: 'admin',        // Full system access
  MANAGER: 'manager',    // Project oversight
  ENGINEER: 'engineer',  // Testing operations
  VIEWER: 'viewer'       // Read-only access
}

// Measurement categorization
MEASUREMENT_TYPES: {
  NORMAL: 'normal',
  FAULT: 'fault',
  TRANSIENT: 'transient'
}
```

### API Architecture

**Current Endpoints** (well-structured RESTful design):
- `GET/POST /api/devices` - Device management
- `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/devices/[id]` - Individual device operations
