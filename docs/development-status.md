## 🔧 Technical Debt

1. **API Route Authentication**: Currently simplified, needs proper middleware
2. **Error Handling**: Needs comprehensive error boundaries and user feedback
3. **Loading States**: Some components need better loading/error states
4. **Type Safety**: Some JavaScript files need TypeScript conversion
5. **Validation**: Zod schemas implemented but not fully integrated

## 📝 Setup Instructions

1. **Database Setup**:
   - Create Supabase project
   - Run `/scripts/database-schema.sql`
   - Run `/scripts/setup-database.sql`

2. **Environment Setup**:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
   - Add Supabase credentials

3. **Create Test Users**:
   - Use Supabase Auth to create users
   - Run SQL in `/scripts/create-test-users.sql` to assign roles

4. **Run Development**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Complete test session creation form
2. Implement Excel import functionality
3. Add measurement management
4. Create compliance reporting
5. Add comprehensive testing
6. Deploy to Netlify

## 📊 Progress Summary

- **Overall Completion**: ~40%
- **Core Features**: ~60%
- **UI/UX**: ~50%
- **Testing**: ~5%
- **Documentation**: ~70%

## 🔗 Key Files

- Database Schema: `/scripts/database-schema.sql`
- Type Definitions: `/types/database.ts`
- Auth Context: `/contexts/AuthContext.js`
- Constants: `/lib/constants.ts`
- API Routes: `/app/api/`
- Components: `/components/`

## 💡 Notes for Continuation

1. The authentication system is working but needs proper session management
2. API routes need consistent error handling and validation
3. The UI uses Tailwind CSS classes inline (no separate config needed)
4. Supabase RLS is configured but needs testing
5. Excel parsing library (xlsx) is installed but not implemented
