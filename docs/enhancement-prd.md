## Epic and Story Structure

### Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision**: **Single Epic Approach** - The four enhancement areas (Analytics, Mobile, Integration, Compliance) are technically interconnected and share common infrastructure components. They build upon the same authentication, database, and UI foundation, making them more efficient to develop as coordinated features rather than separate initiatives.

**Rationale**: The existing architecture is well-designed for extension, and these enhancements complement each other (e.g., mobile interfaces benefit from analytics insights, integration data feeds analytics, compliance automation uses mobile and integration data). A single epic ensures consistent implementation patterns and avoids integration challenges between separate development tracks.

## Epic 1: Solar PV Testing Platform Advanced Enhancement
