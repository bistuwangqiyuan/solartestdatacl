# Solar Disconnect Device Testing Data Management System Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Create an industrial-grade web application for managing photovoltaic disconnect device testing data
- Provide comprehensive data import, storage, visualization, and analysis capabilities for IEC 60947-3 and UL 98B compliance testing
- Enable seamless integration with existing Excel-based testing workflows while modernizing data management
- Deliver real-time dashboards and reporting for testing engineers, quality assurance teams, and regulatory compliance officers
- Establish a scalable platform that can accommodate future testing standards and device types
- Ensure enterprise-level security, audit trails, and data integrity for regulatory compliance

### Background Context

The photovoltaic industry requires rigorous testing of disconnect devices to ensure compliance with international standards such as IEC 60947-3:2020 and UL 98B. Currently, testing data is managed through Excel spreadsheets, creating challenges in data consistency, collaboration, analysis, and regulatory reporting. This system will modernize the testing data lifecycle by providing a centralized, web-based platform that maintains compatibility with existing workflows while enabling advanced analytics and compliance reporting.

The system addresses critical needs in the renewable energy sector where testing data integrity directly impacts product certification and market approval. With the industry's push toward higher voltages (up to 2000V) and increasing testing complexity, a robust data management system is essential for maintaining competitive advantage and regulatory compliance.
